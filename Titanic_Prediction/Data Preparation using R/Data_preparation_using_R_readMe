DataSet_Preparation_Titanic_R.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook. You will have to install Jupyter on you system to execute the code.
It's a clean and ordered way to run and prepare the data to train it using logistic regression. Please change the path_Directory in the 
code as desired.  

Another R file DataSet_Preparation_Titanic_R is also present where whole and some messy code for the project is present which 
I initially worked upon to test and analyze many things before finally coming up to the proper steps.
This R file can be viewed under Rstudio.
